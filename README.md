# Lesson 4 - Due May 22, 2017 (also covered in Lesson 5)

## Assignment

Remember Pauline? Well, she was very happy with your first website you made
for her (or are likely still making.. that assignment is not even due yet),
except she feels like it's not "modern enough."

Given that Pauline doesn't know anything about websites, you're a little
surprised to hear this from her, but she apparently reads some tech blogs
and now thinks the website should be built in React. She's willing to pay
you again and you've been meaning to learn how React on the front end works
anyway, so uh... cool? Same design? Maybe with some better functionality.

You didn't really know how to get started, so you picked up [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)
and have some bare bones to how we get a React project started.

### Goals

- Understand the basics of the React framework and React-Router

### The actual assignment

The list and the detail page will be hooked up, but you'll need to do the `Add
to Order` button and the `Basket` page again.

This means Creating a basket component, routing to it and being able to fill it
with items from the order.

## Getting Started

- Get React Dev Tools installed on your browser.
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/react%20dev%20tools?hl=en-US)
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

`npm i`

`npm start`

Visit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>

`npm test` will run any unit tests (though they are sparse on this project)
